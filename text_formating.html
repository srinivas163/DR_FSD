		The <b>HyperText</b> <strong>Markup Language or</strong> <i>HTML is the standard markup language</i> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. <u>It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</u>
		<br><br>
		<mark>Web browsers receive HTML documents</mark> from a web server or <del>from local</del> storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML <em>describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</em>
		<br><br>
		HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since <sup>1997</sup>.[2] A form of HTML, known as <sub>HTML5</sub>, <small>is used to display video and audio</small>, <big>primarily using the element, together with JavaScript.</big>
